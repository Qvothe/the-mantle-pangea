- [ ] No pre-commit hooks
- [ ] No CI/CD pipeline

### 3. **Security Vulnerabilities** ⚠️
- [ ] No Content Security Policy headers
- [ ] Missing CORS configuration

- [ ] Large bundle size (not analyzed)
- [ ] No lazy loading for heavy components
- [ ] Missing service worker caching strategies
- [ ] No CDN configuration

### 5. **Data & Backend** ❌
- [ ] All data is mocked/hardcoded

- [ ] No data persistence
- [ ] No real-time updates (WebSocket mocked)

### 6. **Authentication** ⚠️
- [ ] Azure AD integration not tested
- [ ] No session management
- [ ] No refresh token handling
- [ ] Role-based access control not enforced
- [ ] No MFA support

### 7. **Error Handling** ⚠️
- [ ] No global error boundary
- [ ] Limited error logging
- [ ] No error reporting service
- [ ] Missing fallback UI for failures

### 8. **Monitoring & Observability** ❌
- [ ] No application monitoring (APM)
- [ ] No error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] No performance monitoring
- [ ] No user analytics
- [ ] No logging infrastructure

### 9. **Deployment** ❌
- [ ] No deployment configuration
- [ ] Missing environment variables documentation
- [ ] No Docker configuration
- [ ] No load balancing setup
- [ ] No SSL/TLS configuration

### 10. **Compliance & Legal** ❌
- [ ] No privacy policy integration
- [ ] Missing cookie consent
- [ ] No GDPR compliance
- [ ] No accessibility audit (WCAG)
- [ ] No license file

## Production Readiness Score: 25/100

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Build Pipeline**
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck  # Should pass
   npm run lint       # Should pass
   npm run test       # Should have >80% coverage
   npm run build      # Should complete without errors
   ```

2. **Implement Real Backend**
   - Set up API endpoints
   - Connect to database
   - Implement authentication service
   - Add data validation

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Add security headers
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Set up HTTPS/SSL
   - Add input validation

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Run Lighthouse audit
   - Optimize images
   - Implement code splitting
   - Add caching strategies

5. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Add error tracking
   - Implement logging
   - Set up performance monitoring
   - Add uptime monitoring

## Testing Commands

Run these to check production readiness:

```bash
# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint

# Unit tests
npm run test:coverage

# Full production test suite
npm run test:prod

# Bundle size analysis
npm run build -- --analyze

# Security audit
npm audit

# Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --view
```

## Estimated Time to Production: 4-6 weeks

With a dedicated team, the following timeline is realistic:
- Week 1-2: Backend implementation and API integration
- Week 3: Security hardening and authentication
- Week 4: Performance optimization and testing
- Week 5: Deployment setup and monitoring
- Week 6: Final testing and go-live preparation

## Conclusion

The Mantle is currently a **functional prototype** with excellent UI/UX design, but requires significant work before production deployment. The main gaps are:
1. No real backend/database
2. Insufficient testing
3. Security vulnerabilities
4. No monitoring/observability
5. Missing deployment infrastructure
