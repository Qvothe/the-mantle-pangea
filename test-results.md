**Total Scenarios: 10**
**Passed: 7**
**Partial: 1**
**Failed: 2**
**Pass Rate: 70%**

## Critical Issues Found

1. **TypeScript Errors** in shadcn/ui components (calendar, chart)
2. **Missing Backend Integration** - All data is mocked
3. **No Authentication System** - Azure AD SSO not implemented
4. **Limited Mobile Responsiveness** - Only desktop optimized
5. **No Data Persistence** - Predictions, wishlist not saved
6. **Missing Upload/Submit Features** - Forms not functional

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Fix TypeScript errors in UI components
2. Implement backend API integration
3. Add authentication system
4. Complete mobile responsive design

### Medium Priority
1. Add data persistence (localStorage/API)
2. Implement upload functionality
3. Add error boundaries
4. Complete form submissions

### Low Priority
1. Add loading states
2. Implement code splitting
3. Add image optimization
4. Create admin interface

## Overall Assessment
The Mantle successfully delivers on its core promise of being an engaging internal culture dashboard. The UI is polished, animations are smooth, and the product-themed design is well-executed. However, it's currently a frontend-only prototype that needs backend integration and authentication to be production-ready.

**Production Readiness: 65%**
